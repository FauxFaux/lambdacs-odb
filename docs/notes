?/N	Mac OS X seems to mess up recognition of ".", "/", and "~" in file choosers?!
		(See Launch.java & SourceFileFinder.java)

	it's own location (which doesn't handle buttons & data) WEIRD!

?/N	MAC OS X doesn't implement the bell correctly. It prints out ^G to STDOUT.

! 	H/N	Evaluating a expression in the alternate timeline after a previous run
	and changing a value will break with:
	DebuggerException: time >= eot() 238 >= 230

! 	M/N	Unparented methods do odd stuff when calling super() ? (no?)
